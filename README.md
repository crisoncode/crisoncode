👋🏻 Hello world, This is Cristian a 31 years old developer!

Since I was very young I have been interested by the technology 🧑🏻‍💻 in general. My first introduction to this world was with videogames in a Sega console. After some years playing games finally my fathers bought a computer and I was excited with this new machine in my home. I started to discover how a computer works and I had a lot of questions in my head. 

🤔 What means this black screen with white letters when I press the power on button? 

🏴‍☠️ What exactly happens when I’m uninstalling a program from the control panel in a Windows 98?

🤘🏻 How I can install windows XP on my computer?

After years, hours of gaming and hours of learning I started to study the computer science in the institute of my hometown. It was a really exciting journey, I learned how the computer works in terms of hardware, how the networks works in our houses, in a world scale (more or less, to be honest I hate this part of the computer science 🤣)

In my third year of study I discovered the art of coding, this was the biggest change of my whole life and I felt in love with that.

Today, after 10 years working as a developer I’m a Javascript senior developer working in Salesforce Commerce Cloud a private software platform focused on digital commerce for big companies.

If you have spent these two minutes of your live reading this, thanks a lot!
