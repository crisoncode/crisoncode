## 〽️ Pair programming

What exactly means Pair Programming?

> *Write **all** the production code with two devs only in one machine*
> 
> Kent Beck , eXtreme Programming 2004

This is a **social activity** 👥 and **should be flexible**, maybe with someone you’re more comfortable with one methodology and with another workmate you prefeer to work without pomodoros.
 

On our daily work can be stresfull to work with a workmate for the whole day because **we have the habit of work alone**  but in other industries the people works with a workmate always

## 💀 Myths and assumptions of pair programming

❌  We’re loosing the double of time in the same task.

⚔️  We must re-evaluate tasks because two devs will imply more effort.

### 🥇 **What values gives the pair programming to us?**

🎧  *Mantain the focus in a task*

💡  *Generate better ideas (Two minds thinking)*

🗣️  *Clarify ideas and share knowledge*

💪🏻  *Take the initiative when the other is a bit frustrating or lost*

🕵🏻  *Mantain mutually the alert about team practices*

## 🔎 Types of pair programming
&nbsp;<br>


### 🚖 **Driver / Navigator**
&nbsp;<br>

The most famous way, one dev (The driver) is coding and the other dev (The navigator) is in the background.
From my point of view the easiest way to start.

*🚗 **The driver:*** 

🎯 Focus in code, writting pieces like methods, etc..

🗣️ Speaks about all the things that he/she is doing

🧑‍💻 Tactical vision of the current task
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

***🗺️ Navigator:***

👂 Observe, accompanies and check “on-the-go”

🧩 More strategic vision (next steps)
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>



### 🏓  PingPong

Can remember test driven development but in this case with a workmate.	

1. 🧪 One dev writes the test
2. 👩🏻‍💻 One dev writes the implementation
3. *🔎 Refactor (Optional)*
4. ↪️ Rotate
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>


### 💪 Strong-style pairing

When someone is too much junior and is working with someone that have experience.
&nbsp;<br>

*🚗 **The driver:*** 

🤨  Full trustability in the navigator

🗣️ Feel comfortable with a lack of information
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>

***🗺️ Navigator:***

👂 Think and giving the next instruction 

🧩 Level of abstraction that is enough to be understanded 

✅ I*t’s a bit dangerous because in somecases can be felt as  micromanagement.*

✅ *It’s more focused for formations, mentoring process for juniors, etc..*
&nbsp;<br>

### 🕵🏻 Pair development

The tasks that we’re doing on each day not implies only code, we spent  time in other things, this method does not have a definition.

You should be creative in this cases making a mix of the other ones (or creating your method)

🌎 Planification 

✍🏻 Documentation

🗺️ Explorations and investigations

## **🕧 Timing**

Management of time.

- Traditionally 20-25min
- Optional: pomodoro

**Rotations**

- Same or other persons
- Times with the same person
